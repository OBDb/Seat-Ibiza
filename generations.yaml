  - name: "First Generation (021A)"
    start_year: 1984
    end_year: 1993
    description: "The first-generation SEAT Ibiza (codenamed 021A) was introduced at the 1984 Paris Motor Show, marking SEAT's first car developed as an independent company after separating from Fiat. Designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro at Italdesign with mechanical components developed in collaboration with Porsche (advertised as 'System Porsche'), the Ibiza featured Italian styling and German engineering. Based on the SEAT Ronda (which was derived from the Fiat Ritmo), it was larger than typical superminis like the Ford Fiesta and Opel Corsa. Available in three and five-door configurations, it offered a 320-liter boot expanding to 1,200 liters with rear seats folded. Engine options included 0.9-liter, 1.2-liter, 1.5-liter, and 1.7-liter gasoline units plus a 1.7-liter diesel, with power outputs from 44 to 100 horsepower. A light facelift in early 1989 brought a new grille and interior, while the 1991 'New Style' version offered more thorough updates. The first-generation Ibiza proved highly successful, selling 1,342,001 units before the second generation arrived in 1993. Production continued in China until 2008 as the Nanjing Yuejin Soyat."

    end_year: 2002
    description: "The second-generation SEAT Ibiza (Typ 6K) was the first developed entirely under Volkswagen Group ownership, utilizing a platform shared with the Volkswagen Polo Mk3 and Golf Mk3. Again designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro, the new Ibiza featured more rounded styling while maintaining a sporty character. Available in three and five-door hatchback configurations, with saloon and estate variants sold as the SEAT Córdoba. Engine options expanded significantly, including 1.0-liter to 2.0-liter gasoline units and 1.9-liter diesel variants, with the range-topping Cupra producing up to 156 horsepower. A minor facelift in 1996 added smoother bumpers and new headlights, while the more substantial 1999 facelift (6K2) brought revised front and rear styling, a new dashboard, and the tailgate-mounted SEAT badge that doubled as a boot release. The sporty Cupra and Cupra R variants became icons of SEAT's performance image. The second generation achieved significant success, winning 'Car of the Year 1994' in Spain and Portugal, and selling 1,522,607 units before production ended in 2002."

    description: "The third-generation SEAT Ibiza (Typ 6L) was built on the Volkswagen Group PQ24 platform shared with the VW Polo Mk4 and Škoda Fabia. Styled by Walter de Silva to emphasize sportiness and performance, the Mk3 Ibiza was larger than its predecessors with improved interior space. Available in three and five-door hatchbacks, with the Córdoba saloon continuing until 2009. Engine options ranged from 1.2-liter to 1.8-liter gasoline engines (including a 180-horsepower 1.8T in the Cupra) and 1.4-liter to 1.9-liter TDI diesel variants, with the FR and Cupra R representing top performance models. A 2006 facelift brought cosmetic updates to the interior and exterior plus enhanced equipment. The third-generation Ibiza received critical acclaim, winning 'Car of the Year 2003' and 'Supermini of the Year' for three consecutive years from What Car? magazine. Euro NCAP awarded it a 4-star safety rating. Production continued until 2008, with the 2.0-liter engine variant lasting until 2009 in Latin American markets."

    description: "The fourth-generation SEAT Ibiza (Typ 6J) was the first in its segment to use Volkswagen Group's PQ25 platform, later shared with the VW Polo Mk5 and Audi A1. Styled by Luc Donckerwolke featuring a distinctive 'arrow design' language previewed by the 2008 Bocanegra concept, the Mk4 Ibiza marked a bold departure from previous generations. Available as a five-door hatchback, three-door Sport Coupé (SC), and five-door estate (Ibiza ST introduced in 2010). Engine options included 1.0-liter to 1.8-liter gasoline units (including innovative TSI turbocharged engines) and 1.2-liter to 2.0-liter TDI diesels, with the high-performance FR and Cupra variants using a 1.4-liter TSI twincharger producing up to 180 horsepower. A 2012 facelift brought exterior and interior refreshments, while a more thorough 2015 update introduced full LED headlights, improved quality materials, and enhanced connectivity via Full Link technology.

Available exclusively as a five-door hatchback (discontinuing the SC and ST variants), it was designed under Julio Lozano with sharper, more angular styling.
