generations:
  - name: "First Generation"
    start_year: 1984
    end_year: 1993
    description: "The first-generation SEAT Ibiza marked a significant milestone for the Spanish manufacturer as its first car developed as an independent company following its separation from Fiat. Designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro with mechanical components developed with Porsche's engineering input (prominently advertised with 'System Porsche' badging on the engine), the original Ibiza was a compact hatchback available in three and five-door configurations. Measuring approximately 3.68 meters in length, the Ibiza featured angular, functional styling typical of 1980s Giugiaro designs. Engine options included 0.9-liter, 1.2-liter, 1.5-liter, and 1.7-liter gasoline units, plus a 1.7-liter diesel, with power outputs ranging from 44 to 100 horsepower, paired with four or five-speed manual transmissions. The interior was straightforward and functional, with an emphasis on space efficiency rather than luxury. A mild facelift in 1989 brought subtle styling updates and minor mechanical improvements. Despite being SEAT's first independently developed model, the Ibiza proved successful, particularly in Southern European markets, establishing the nameplate that would become the brand's bestseller and helping position SEAT in the European market before its acquisition by the Volkswagen Group in 1986."

  - name: "Second Generation"
    start_year: 1993
    end_year: 2002
    description: "The second-generation SEAT Ibiza was the first developed entirely under Volkswagen Group ownership, utilizing a platform derived from the Volkswagen Polo but with distinctive styling and character. Again designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro, the new Ibiza featured more rounded styling than its predecessor while maintaining a recognizable silhouette. Available in three and five-door hatchback configurations, the second-generation Ibiza grew slightly to approximately 3.83 meters in length. Engine options expanded to include Volkswagen Group powertrains, with gasoline options ranging from 1.0-liter to 2.0-liter and diesel options including 1.9-liter naturally aspirated and turbocharged variants, with power outputs between 45 and 150 horsepower in the range-topping Cupra sport version. The interior quality improved significantly over the previous generation, reflecting Volkswagen's influence. A substantive facelift in 1999 (sometimes called Mk2 Phase 2) brought updated exterior styling with new headlights, grille, and taillights, plus a refreshed interior and additional equipment. Special versions included the sporty GTI and later Cupra models, and the stylish 'Sport' editions with unique color schemes and equipment. The second-generation Ibiza further established the model as SEAT's core offering, successfully blending Volkswagen engineering with more distinctive styling and sportier character than its German counterpart."

  - name: "Third Generation"
    start_year: 2002
    end_year: 2008
    description: "The third-generation SEAT Ibiza (internally designated 6L) represented a more distinctive departure from its Volkswagen Group relatives, featuring bold styling by Walter de'Silva that established a new design language for the SEAT brand. Available in three and five-door hatchback configurations, the third-generation Ibiza grew to approximately 3.97 meters in length. Built on an updated version of the Volkswagen Group A04 platform shared with the contemporary Volkswagen Polo, the new Ibiza offered improved interior space and safety features. Engine options included gasoline units ranging from 1.2 to 1.8 liters, including the 1.8-liter 20VT in the Cupra producing 180 horsepower, and diesel options centered around the 1.9 TDI in various states of tune from 64 to 160 horsepower in the FR TDI. Transmission options included five and six-speed manuals and a robotized 'sequential-automatic' transmission called Tiptronic. The interior featured a more distinctive design with improved materials and equipment, including available climate control, cruise control, and enhanced audio systems. A facelift in 2006 brought revised styling with new headlights, grille, and bumpers, plus interior refinements and additional equipment. The third-generation Ibiza further developed SEAT's sporting character with the performance-oriented FR (Formula Racing) and Cupra variants, which gained significant following, particularly in European markets where hot hatchbacks were popular. This generation successfully distinguished SEAT more clearly from Volkswagen, positioning it as the younger, sportier brand within the group."

  - name: "Fourth Generation"
    start_year: 2008
    end_year: 2017
    description: "The fourth-generation SEAT Ibiza (internally designated 6J) was the first to use the Volkswagen Group's PQ25 platform, which it later shared with the Volkswagen Polo and Audi A1. Designed under Luc Donckerwolke, formerly of Lamborghini, the new Ibiza featured more sculpted, dynamic styling with sharp character lines and angular headlights that established the design direction for other SEAT models. Initially available as a five-door hatchback, with a sportier three-door 'SC' (Sport Coupé) and an 'ST' estate variant added later—the first time an Ibiza wagon had been offered. The fourth-generation Ibiza grew to approximately 4.05 meters in length for the standard model, providing improved interior space while maintaining compact exterior dimensions. Engine options included gasoline units ranging from 1.0 to 1.4 liters, including innovative 1.2 and 1.4 TSI turbocharged engines, and diesel options centered around the 1.2, 1.6, and 2.0 TDI units, with power outputs ranging from 60 to 180 horsepower in the Cupra variant. Transmission options included five and six-speed manuals, six-speed automatic, and seven-speed DSG dual-clutch automatic depending on engine selection. The interior featured improved quality with soft-touch materials in some areas, available climate control, and enhanced technology including touchscreen infotainment systems in later models. A significant facelift in 2012 updated the exterior styling with modified headlights and bumpers, while adding LED daytime running lights and introducing SEAT's new corporate grille design. The fourth-generation Ibiza successfully continued the model's positioning as a stylish, somewhat sportier alternative to the Volkswagen Polo, particularly appealing to younger buyers thanks to its dynamic design and the performance-oriented FR and Cupra variants."

  - name: "Fifth Generation"
    start_year: 2017
    end_year: null
    description: "The fifth-generation SEAT Ibiza (internally designated KJ1) was the first Volkswagen Group model to use the MQB A0 platform, later shared with models like the Volkswagen Polo, SEAT Arona, and Škoda Scala. Unveiled at the 2017 Geneva Motor Show, the new Ibiza is available exclusively as a five-door hatchback, with SEAT discontinuing the three-door SC and ST wagon variants offered in the previous generation. Designed under Alejandro Mesonero-Romanos, the fifth-generation Ibiza features sharper, more angular styling with triangular headlights, pronounced character lines, and an overall more mature appearance while maintaining the model's sporty character. Despite having similar exterior dimensions to its predecessor at approximately 4.06 meters long, the new platform enables significantly improved interior space, particularly rear passenger room and cargo capacity, which increased to 355 liters. Engine options at launch included 1.0 MPI naturally aspirated and 1.0 TSI turbocharged three-cylinder gasoline engines, a 1.5 TSI four-cylinder, and 1.6 TDI diesel variants, with power outputs ranging from 75 to 150 horsepower. Transmission options include five and six-speed manuals and a seven-speed DSG dual-clutch automatic depending on engine selection. The interior represents a significant upgrade with improved materials, a more modern design with an available 8-inch touchscreen infotainment system supporting Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and a comprehensive suite of driver assistance systems including adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking, and tiredness recognition. A subtle facelift in 2021 brought minor styling updates, enhanced connectivity features, and full LED headlights across the range. Unlike previous generations, performance FR models are offered, but no Cupra variant was developed as the Cupra brand was separated from SEAT in 2018. The fifth-generation Ibiza has continued the model's success, maintaining its position as SEAT's best-selling vehicle while offering a compelling combination of practicality, technology, and engaging driving dynamics in the competitive supermini segment."
